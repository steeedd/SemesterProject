        "   - bridge tables\n",
        "3. Test Your Logic: Do not generate the final answer yet.\n",
        "   - You must run a \"Test Query\" to verify your hypothesis.\n",

        "    - Check Foreign Keys: Do NOT join on `id` unless you are sure it is a foreign key.\n",
        "    - Bridge Tables: If Table A and Table C have no direct link, look for a middle table B:\n",
